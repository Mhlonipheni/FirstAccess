    <h5>
        <strong>How does First Access work?</strong><br />
        Participating restaurants list their first table of the evening on the First Access website. The restaurant chooses the 
        days it's available and the times it's available.<br /><br />

        <strong>How many can I book for?</strong><br />
        First Table reservations are for groups of 2 to 4 people (including children).<br /><br />

        <strong>Can I bring more than 4 people?</strong><br />
        No, sorry. Our arrangement with the restaurants is for reservations of 2 to 4 people. If you make a reservation for 
        4 people the restaurant will have a table reserved for 4 people, not more.  The deal does not apply to single diners.<br /><br />

        <strong>Is the booking fee per table or per person?</strong><br />
        The booking fee is per table.<br /><br />

        <strong>What time can I book for?</strong><br />
        The restaurant lists the time that their first table is available for.<br /><br />
        
        <strong>What happens if I'm late for my reservation?</strong><br />
        The 50% off meals deal is only available for the date and time you have booked. If you are more than 15 minutes late the
        deal is off.<br /><br />

        <strong>Can I cancel/change my reservation?</strong><br />
        Yes you may cancel your reservation, but the booking fee is non-refundable and is not transferable to an alternative date.
        If you would like to cancel/amend your booking please contact First Access.<br /><br />

        <strong>Can I pick which table to sit at?</strong><br />
        The restaurant will likely have a designated table for their First Access diners.<br /><br />

        <strong>Are drinks discounted?</strong><br />
        No, the first table offer is for 50% off meals only.<br /><br />

        <strong>Is there a minimum spend?</strong><br />
        No, you may spend as much or as little as you like, and your food bill will be discounted by 50%.<br /><br />

        <strong>Is dessert included?</strong><br />
        Yes all food ordered is discounted by 50%.<br /><br />

        <strong>Can I book the same restaurant twice?</strong><br />
        Yes, but not twice in a row.<br /><br />

        <strong>What time is a new day added?</strong><br />
        Availability for every restaurant rolls over at midnight.<br /><br />

        <strong>Is the booking fee deducted from my bill?</strong><br />
        No, the booking fee entitles you to 50% off food only when you make your reservation and is not deductible from the bill.<br /><br />

        <strong>Are there any exclusions?</strong><br />
        Some restaurants may have certain items that are unavailable for the First Access offer, please ensure you check the 
        'Special Conditions' to avoid any disappointment.<br /><br />
        
        <strong>Booking Confirmations</strong><br />
        Booking confirmations are emailed out once payment has been finalised.  If you cannot find your confirmation email simply 
        log into your First Access account, select Reservations from the drop down list where your name is displayed and download 
        the relevant PDF.  Easy!  Alternatively, check your email junk folder - sometimes first time bookings can end up in there.<br /><br />
